# 👑 Conversational Time Machine – Queen Elizabeth II (1926–1953)

_“I declare before you all that my whole life shall be devoted to your service…”_

A voice-driven, AI-powered interface that allows you to have natural, historically grounded conversations with **Queen Elizabeth II**, focused on her early life (from birth in 1926 up to her coronation in 1953).

## 🎬 Inspiration

After watching *The Crown* and witnessing the quiet strength and leadership of Queen Elizabeth II, I was moved to build a project that captures her voice, her memory, and her legacy in a respectful and engaging way. As a history enthusiast and AI developer, I saw the potential for blending **LLMs**, **retrieval-based learning**, and **text-to-speech** to make history feel personal and alive.

## 🧠 What Is This?

An interactive chatbot that brings a historical figure to life using:

- 📚 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** over real speeches, public letters & Wiki archives
- 🤖 **Gemini Pro 1.5 Flash** for context-aware, time-constrained LLM generation
- 🗣️ **Coqui TTS (Open Source)** for rich voice synthesis (British female voice)
- 💻 **Streamlit** frontend for real-time chat with voice output

---

## 🎯 Project Scope

This project focuses **only** on the early life of Queen Elizabeth II, including:

- Her childhood and royal upbringing
- Experiences during WWII
- Her father's death and becoming heir presumptive
- Her coronation in 1953

It avoids post-1953 knowledge entirely to maintain historical accuracy.
